Execution order vs Coding Order

--CODING ORDER--
Coding order we do so that don't get error

coding order executed is from TOP to Bottom
SELECT DISTINCT    - to filter columns SELECT, to filter duplicates DISTINCT
  Column 1,
  SUM(Column 2)
FROM Table
WHERE Col = 10   - WHERE to filter rows before aggregation
GROUP BY Col 1
HAVING SUM(Col 2) > 30    - HAVING to filter rows after aggregation
ORDER BY col 1 ASC
LIMIT 3;          - to filter result rows

-- SQL EXECUTION ORDER --
here below see how sql execution take place

1) FROM Table - so here first sql go to database and find table then
2) WHERE query will be applied - it filter data and then 
3) GROUP BY - it start combining similar values from rows and then aggregate data based
on rules you have defined then
4) HAVING condition will be applied and keep the rest
5) SELECT DISTINCT - going to be execute
6) ORDER BY - now it will sort the data and last
7) TOP / LIMIT - will showcase no of top rows which you want


So coding order is completely different then execution order
