SEARCH Operator

(watch video to understand)

- LIKE 
(Search for pattern in text)

pattern to search 
we use 1) % is used to search anything  from no character , one character, or many charcters
       2) _ if underscore is used we search specific exactly character or 1

	   % is being used way more it is famous

example here 

1)    M%
M =	character we want to search and % = anything after M
so output = Maria  

here M = is character with matches
   aria = anything

Output Ma 
Output Emma not correct and will not be shown by SQL
E is at starting


2)  %in
   % = anything  before in

eg Martin 
mar = anything  and also it is before in

Vin = accepted 
in = accepted 
Jashmine = rejected ne is last two characters we want in and before that anything
